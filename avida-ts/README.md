# Typescript library for AVIDA

## Local development

Please make sure you have built the contracts before running the local demo.

```bash
# at the root of the repo
make build
```

You also have to set write permission on the contract addresss file:

```bash
echo CONTRACT_ADDRESS= > avida-ts/env/local.contract
```

### Create local networks

This step creates a local cheqd node, a local standalone neutron node and a relayer. All chain config files are in
`docker/local-chain-config`.

Then we can bring up docker containers:

```bash
# starting in ./avida-ts
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.local.yaml up --remove-orphans
```

This does several things

1. `scripts/cheqd-genesis.sh` creates a cheqd node with a genesis tx to pre-fund the relayer and resource owner
   accounts.
2. `scripts/cheqd-resource-uploader.sh` uploads the demo cheqd resource from `docker/cheqd-resource-artifacts`.
3. `scripts/neutron-deploy.sh` deploys the `avida-sdjwt-verifier` contract to neutron and sets the contract address in
   `./local.contract`
4. `scripts/relayer-avida-link.sh` waits for the new contract address in `./contract.env` and when available create a
   client & connection & channel, then starts relaying messages between the cheqd/x/resource module and the
   `avida-sdjwt-verifier` contract.
5. a neutron node also gets started without custom scripts as see in the `docker-compose.local.yaml` file

> The local network takes a few mins to start up, please wait for the relayer to start before running the demo. You can
> check the logs of the relayer to see when it is ready by looking for `AVIDA Path created!`

## Run demo

`avida-ts` directory has packages to support the demo.

> The local network takes a few mins to start up, please wait for the relayer to start before running the demo.

```bash
pnpm setup
pnpm run build
echo CONTRACT_ADDRESS= > ./env/local.contract
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.local.yaml up --remove-orphans
# wait until you get the message "AVIDA Path created!" or follow `hermer-relayer-1` logs
pnpm run local-demo
```

Deploy the contract to the `pion-1` network:

```bash
# store code
neutrond tx wasm store artifacts/avida_sdjwt_verifier-aarch64.wasm \
  --chain-id pion-1 \
  --node https://neutron-testnet-rpc.polkachu.com:443 \
  --from avida \
  --gas "auto" \
  --gas-adjustment 1.1  \
  --gas-prices "0.05untrn" \

# instantiate contract at stored code_id
neutrond tx wasm instantiate 6057 '{"max_presentation_len": 30000, "init_registrations": []}' \
  --admin="$(neutrond keys show avida -a)" \
  --label "avida-sd-jwt-verifier" \
  --chain-id pion-1 \
  --node https://neutron-testnet-rpc.polkachu.com:443 \
  --from avida \
  --gas "auto" \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3  \
  --gas-prices "0.08untrn" \
  -y
```
